# Starting point for own config, maybe documentation if someone wants to use it someday

## List of interesting plugins I would like to look further into

- [Blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp) - A potential alternative to nvim-cmp and coq.nvim
- [Persisted](https://github.com/olimorris/persisted.nvim) - Potential plugin for session management with telescope integration
