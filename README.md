# Starting point for own config, maybe documentation if someone wants to use it someday

## List of interesting plugins I would like to look further into

- [Blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp) - A potential alternative to nvim-cmp and coq.nvim

## To-Do List for the config

- Rewrite everything from Telescope to either FzFLua or other Plugins
  - Telescope -> FzFLua
  - Telescope File_Browser -> Neotree or something else
  - Neoclip -> Rewrite to FzFLua and make it work
- Rewrite config from using CMP to Blink.cmp
  - See how sources are supported
  - See if overall setup is working and usable
